WP GoToWebinar displays a listing or calendar of upcoming webinars using a shortcode or widget which can link to a registration form on your website.


== Description ==

WP GoToWebinar is a totally free plugin used to display upcoming webinars in a table, calendar or widget from your GoToWebinar account which link to registration forms on your website.

By using simple shortcodes or the WPBakery Page Builder plugin you can place upcoming webinars or registration forms on any post or page with ease.

As webinars pass and new webinars are created, the upcoming webinar display updates automatically each day making WP GoToWebinar a zero-maintenance experience.

Use the shortcode [gotowebinar] to display webinars in a table format, [gotowebinar-calendar] to display webinars in a calendar format, [gotowebinar-reg key=”YOUR WEBINAR KEY”] to display a registration form for a specific webinar, or use [gotowebinar-reg key=”upcoming”] to show a registration form of your next upcoming webinar!

There’s also a range of additional shortcode parameter that can be used which can:

1. Only show webinars from a particular timezone
2. Only show webinars if the webinar title contains or doesn't contain particular text
3. Only show webinars within the next X number of days
4. Hide a certain phrase in the title from displaying

Please checkout the plugin FAQ section for more information on the different shortcode parameters, or better yet use the WPBakery Page Builder plugin.

WP GoToWebinar also enables your users to convert the times and dates of upcoming webinar displays and registration forms into their local timezone with a click of a link! Reduce spam registrations with Google reCaptcha support.

Translate/customise standard registration form fields and create dynamic success and error messages for your users simply and quickly. Customise colours of various elements and enable hover tooltips to provide additional information to your users on upcoming webinars and registration forms.

WP GoToWebinar is mobile friendly, implements smart caching to make loading times super fast and it's also unobtrusive so it should adapt fairly well to your themes existing styles. Using our 1-click GoToWebinar authentication process and simple user interface you'll have things up and running in no time! Watch a full walkthrough of all these features in this video here:
